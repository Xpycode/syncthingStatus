# Discovery Interview

Run the full discovery interview from `docs/00_base.md`.

Read `docs/00_base.md` and execute the "Discovery Interview" section:

1. Ask the core questions (one at a time, conversationally)
2. Ask follow-up questions based on answers
3. Map answers to architecture using `docs/04_architecture-decisions.md`
4. Update `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` with findings
5. Update project `CLAUDE.md` with tech stack and architecture

This is for new projects or when revisiting project scope.
