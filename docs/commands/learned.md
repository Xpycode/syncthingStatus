# Add to Glossary

Add a term I learned to my personal glossary (`44_my-glossary.md` in the Directions master).

Ask me:
1. **What term?** - The word or concept
2. **What does it mean?** - Plain language explanation
3. **Why does it matter?** - Why I'd care about this (optional but helpful)

Then add it to the Directions master glossary with today's date and the current project name as context.

Format:
```markdown
## [TERM]
*Asked: YYYY-MM-DD during [project name or "general learning"]*

[Explanation]

**Why it matters:** [Relevance]
