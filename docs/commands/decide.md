# Log Decision

We just made a decision worth recording.

Ask:
1. "What did we decide?"
2. "What were the alternatives?"
3. "Why this choice?"

Then append to `docs/decisions.md`:

```markdown
### [DATE] - [Decision Title]
**Context:** [What prompted this]
**Options:** [What we considered]
**Decision:** [What we chose]
**Rationale:** [Why]
```
