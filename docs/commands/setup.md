# Project Setup

Run the project detection flow:

1. Check if `docs/00_base.md` exists (Directions already set up)
2. Check if `/docs` folder exists without Directions structure
3. Check for scattered `.md` files
4. Determine if this is a new empty project

Based on what you find, offer the appropriate options as described in the global CLAUDE.md under "Project Detection".

Execute the detection now and guide me through setup.
