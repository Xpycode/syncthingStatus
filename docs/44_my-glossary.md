## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
*Asked: 2026-01-10 during project interview*

The smallest version of your product that delivers core value to users. Not a prototype or demo - it's a real, usable product, just stripped to essentials. Ship this first, then add features based on real feedback.

**Why it matters:** Prevents building features nobody wants. Get something working in users' hands fast.
