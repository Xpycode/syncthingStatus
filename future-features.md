# Future Improvements

1. **Diagnostics Pane** – Add a “Health” section that aggregates the latest API errors, sync queue backlogs, and raw config snapshots, with a one-click copy bundle for GitHub issue reports.
2. **Quick Actions** – Expose per-folder actions (pause/resume, rescan, open path) directly in the menu bar popover for faster routine maintenance.
3. **Sync History** – Persist completion percentages and device connectivity over time to power trend charts or CSV exports for performance analysis.
4. **Enhanced Notifications** – Offer optional alerts for low disk space, Syncthing restarts, or folders stuck “syncing” past a custom timeout.
5. **Automation Hooks** – Provide a lightweight CLI or AppleScript interface that mirrors pause/resume/refresh controls to support automation workflows.
6. **Contributor Onboarding** – Document contribution steps (CONTRIBUTING.md), include UI snapshot references, and add a smoke UI test that opens and closes key windows to guard against regressions.
